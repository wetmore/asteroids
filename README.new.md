ASTEROIDS
=========

In canvas! My parents will be so excited!

How do I do this?
-----------------

Use the __arrow keys__ to move, __spacebar__ to shoot, and press __a__ to spawn an asteroid. If you want to face the other direction tap _s_. There are a few debug keys in there right now too.

It's a little known fact that the song "1979" by Smashing Pumpkins is about the game Asteroids, but it's true. First released in 1979, Asteroids was notable partly because it was the first game to use Atari's Digital Vector Generator. If they didn't use a vector approach for the graphics, you could call it "Rasteroids." Please don't do that. I thought asteroids would be a good game to use my [vector library](https://github.com/wetmore/vector.js) for, while getting more acquainted with javascript and the canvas element. Since it uses canvas, you could call it "Canvasteroids." Please don't do that.
