ASTEROIDS
=========

In canvas! My parents will be so excited!
You can play the game [here](http://wetmore.github.com/asteroids/ast.htm). The __arrow keys__ control movement, and you can shoot with __spacebar__. Spawn asteroids with __a__. Pressing __s__ will flip the ship. There ae a few debug keys still there as well.

It's a little known fact that the song "1979" by Smashing Pumpkins is about the game Asteroids, but it's true. First released in 1979, Asteroids was notable partly because it was the first game to use Atari's Digital Vector Generator. If they didn't use a vector approach for the graphics, you could call it "Rasteroids." Please don't do that. I thought asteroids would be a good game to use my [vector library](https://github.com/wetmore/vector.js) for, while getting more acquainted with javascript and the canvas element. Since it uses canvas, you could call it "Canvasteroids." Please don't do that.

The game is more of an engine than anything else at the moment; I'm finding it more interesting to add new features than polish it as a game, because I have no intentions of releasing it. For the moment it is a testbed for me to learn canvas and experiment with.
