In canvas! My parents will be so excited!

It's a little known fact that the song "1979" by Smashing Pumpkins is about the game Asteroids, but it's true. First released in 1979, Asteroids was notable partly because it was the first game to use Atari's Digital Vector Generator. If they didn't use a vector approach for the graphics, you could call it "Rasteroids." Please don't do that. I thought asteroids would be a good game to use my [vector library](https://github.com/wetmore/vector.js) for, while getting more acquainted with javascript and the canvas element. Since it uses canvas, you could call it "Canvasteroids." Please don't do that.

The game is more of an engine than anything else at the moment; I'm finding it more interesting to add new features than polish it as a game, because I have no intentions of releasing it. For the moment it is a testbed for me to learn canvas and experiment with.
